# End user manual

The end user uses the application of which NLI-GO is just a part.

The manual for the end user depends on the application, but here are some guidelines.

## Example user manual

This application allows you to interact with database X using a subset of English.

The sentences you can use follow some very strict patterns, but they also allow for some variations.

The main patterns are:

- Who is X
- Where is X
- Is X married to Y

For X you may fill in the name of a person that is available in the database, but you can also use:

- the father of Z
- the mother of Z
- the son of Z
- the daughter of Z

So, for example, this sentence is possible:

    Is the daughter of Elvis Presley married to the the son of Joe Jackson?
