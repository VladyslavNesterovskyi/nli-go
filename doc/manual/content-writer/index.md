# Content writer

A content writer does not develop an application but writes the grammar, the rules and the solutions.

## The content writing process

There may be different approaches of how to teach the program how to process a sentence. This one is very iterative. 

* Collect a sentence from an end user
* Write a test (that fails)
* Extend the lexicon
* Extend the grammar
* Extend the transformations
* Extend the solutions
* Extend the generations
