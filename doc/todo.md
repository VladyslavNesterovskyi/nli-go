# Known issues

## Syntax

- The syntax is not very useful. Both too little and too much extra tokens.

## Domains

The domain tests are not a goal in themselves, but only help to make up test cases.

- Block's world

## Parsing

- Cannot handle left-recursive rules. Change the parser or restrict the rules?

## Answering

- The way to find an answer to a question is insufficient.

## Generation

- Generate simple responses
