        <header>About this page</header>
        <p>
            This page is a demonstration of <a href="https://github.com/garfix/nli-go">NLI-GO</a>, a natural language library, written in Go, that allows a user to query a database in natural language.<br>
            It connects you to <a href="http://wiki.dbpedia.org/about">DBpedia</a>, a Sparql database that contains data from Wikipedia.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's scope is still quite limited. For example, in the input field above, you can only ask questions of these types:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Who married &lt;PERSON&gt;</li>
            <li>How many children had &lt;PERSON&gt;</li>
            <li>Who was &lt;PERSON&gt;'s father</li>
            <li>Who was &lt;PERSON&gt;'s mother</li>
            <li>When was &lt;PERSON&gt; born</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Where &lt;PERSON&gt; must be the name of a person in the database, it must consist of 2 or 3 words, each of which must start with a capital.<br>
            For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lord Byron</li>
            <li>Elvis Presley</li>
            <li>Michael Jackson</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When your question contains a name that belongs to several people in the database, the application asks you to choose among them.</p>
